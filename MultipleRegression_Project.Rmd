Will Build a Multiple Regression to Measure Effects on Students' Scores on the Science scale from a variety
of key factors including: scores on the Reading scale (the Mathematics scale scores were Excluded as they only had scores for Male students), the GDP per Capita of a Nation, the Share of a Country's Urban Population,
and the Total Food Available in a Country at a Given Time interval.

```{r}
# Ensure that the DataFrame is Ordered by Country and then Year
df <- df[order(df$Country, df$Year), ]

# Let's get to Building a Multiple Regression Model
mul_reg <- lm(`Average performance of 15-year-old students on the science scale` ~ 
              `Average performance of 15-year-old students on the reading scale` + 
              `GDP per Capita ($)` + 
              `Urban Population (% of Total Population)` + 
              `Total Food Available (Kilocalories per day)`, 
              data = df)
