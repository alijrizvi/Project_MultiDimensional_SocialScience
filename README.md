## Overview
This project encompassed a wide variety of deep-dives into differing metrics of socioeconomic progress, demographic changes, and global trends.

The data was collected from "Our World in Data" (ourworldindata.org), being downloaded as separate CSV files and then getting consolidated into one Excel (.xlsm) Workbook as separate sheets.
Each sheet was, subsequently, imported as a Distinct Table into a newly-created Database on PostgreSQL through Python code.

Subsequently, deeper data cleaning and wrangling, EDA and visualization, and machine learning were performed to unearth hidden jewls of trends.
